Welcome to Funk!

Prerequisites:
1) Chicken Scheme (from http://www.callcc.org)
2) easyffi egg    (install with 'chicken-setup easyffi')
3) srfi-66 egg    (install with 'chicken-setup srfi-66')

QuickStart instructions:

1) ./configure
2) make

   This will build the remote_chicken read-eval-print loop that will let you
   interact with Chicken, and package the provided eggs into the eggs/ directory.
   It also builds the demo programs into bin/

3) 
(as root) chicken-setup bit-cat crc16 raw-sockets
   This will download and install the these three eggs from 
   the official Chicken egg repository.

ALTERNATIVELY:
(as root) make install

   This will install the three eggs that are packaged with funk: 
   bit-cat, crc16, and raw-sockets

OPTIONAL:
4) (as root) ./setuid_repl.sh

   This will setuid-root the remote_chicken REPL.  This allows the remote
   Chicken interpreter to act as root, which will let you generate raw
   packets with Funk directly from Eclipse.  This is a gaping security hole, 
   so be careful who has access to the binary.
