# W0142: Used * or * magic* Used when a function or method is called using *args or **kwargs
#        to dispatch arguments. This doesn't improve readility and should be used with care.
# W0102: Dangerous default value %s as argument Used when a mutable value as list or dictionary

# W0212: Access to a protected member %s of a client class Used when a protected member 
#        (i.e. class member with a name beginning with an underscore) is access outside the class 
#        or a descendant of the class where it's defined.
# R0201: Method could be a function. Used when a method doesn't use its bound instance, and so 
#        could be written as a function.
